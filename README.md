# Test the Docs Vale Styles

This repository contains pre-written checks for Vale based on popular style guides. We took them from those created in the [Vale project](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/) that are in the process of being removed, and we wanted to create a new home for them for people to learn how to use this flexible tool.
